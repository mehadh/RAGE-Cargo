# RAGE-Cargo
#### This project is currently in development, and as such, some features may not be completely functional at the moment!
An economic based gamemode for RAGE:MP in which players interact with vehicles such as tractor trailers and planes in order to earn money.

RAGE:Cargo or RAGE:CARGO is a RAGE:MP 1.1 gamemode in which players are primarily engaged in logistics related activities, flying planes and driving tractor trailers in order to increase their wealth.

The server uses MrPancakers2's RAGE Accounts resource (https://github.com/RageMpOpenSource/RAGE-Accounts) for handling accounts and logins along with the initial database schema. 

Features: 
- Admin system: set weather, spawn cars, cancel missions for people. Freecam. Didn't implement admin discipline system, but could easily be plugged in from the rp gamemode on my profile.
- Chat system: pm, coin, me, stats./
- Static vehicles positioned in map including shamal (big plane) cuban 800 (small plane) mule (medium truck) and benson (large truck).
- Four airports scripted with cargo and passenger pickup locations.
- Port fully scripted for trucking deliveries + 5 businesses scripted for deliveries.
- Vehicles auto respawn on their own after being abandoned.
